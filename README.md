# car_trader_nextjs
 * :runner: :runner: :runner: Fully responsive car trader web app with NextJS written with TypeScript, Prisma, sqlite
 * Used Prisma ORM to create models and migrate them into db, also used CRUD filtering to retrieve data
 * did optimization by caching data from API using SWR hooks, rendering data become 2secs faster than default fetching data, which definetely increased MY UX, xd
 * reduced API calls by 60% with shallow routing and by setting intervals in SWR
 * Used Material UI's Selectors, Paginators and Grid system to build responsive application
