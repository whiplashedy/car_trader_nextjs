# car_trader_nextjs
 * Fully responsive car trader web app with NextJS written with TypeScript :cop:, Prisma :fire:, sqlite :bookmark_tabs:
 * Used Prisma ORM :fire: to create models and migrate them into db, also used simple data from queries to make CRUD filtering to retrieve data from database
 * did optimization by caching data :open_file_folder: from API using SWR hooks, rendering data become 2secs faster than default fetching data, which definetely increased MY UX, xd
 * reduced API calls by 60% :chart: with shallow routing and by setting intervals in SWR
 * Used Material UI's Selectors, Paginators and Grid system to build responsive application :heart_eyes:
